## Contact Manager - Python

This is a simple contact manager built using Python for the Rocketseat challenge. The goal of this project is to explore the fundamentals of the Python language.

**Features:**

- **Add Contacts:** Allows you to add new contacts with name, phone number, and email address.
- **View Contacts:** Displays a complete list of all registered contacts, with the option to view favorite contacts.
- **Mark as Favorite:** Marks a contact as a favorite for quick access.
- **Unmark as Favorite:** Removes the favorite status from a contact.
- **Delete Contacts:** Removes a contact from the contact list.

**Objective:**

The objective of this project is to showcase basic concepts of the Python language, such as:

- **Classes and Objects:** The `Contact` class defines the structure of a contact, with attributes such as name, phone number, email, and favorite status.
- **Functions:** Functions like `append_contact`, `show_contacts`, `mark_favorite_contact`, and `delete_contact` organize the code into reusable blocks, improving maintainability and readability.
- **Lists:** Lists are used to store contacts, allowing you to add, remove, and iterate through them.
- **Input and Output:** The program interacts with the user through input (input) and displays information (print).
- **Flow Control:** The `while` loop and `if` and `elif` conditionals are used to control the program flow and user interaction.

**How to Use:**

1. **Run the Code:** Execute the `main.py` file in your Python interpreter.
2. **Interact with the Menu:** Use the menu to navigate the program's functionality and interact with the contact list.
3. **Use the Features:** Add, view, mark as favorite, unmark, and delete contacts.

**Project Structure:**

- **`main.py`:** Main file containing the user interaction menu and the main program logic.
- **`contacts.py`:** File containing the `Contact` class and functions for managing contacts.

**Notes:**

- This project was developed for educational purposes and to demonstrate basic Python concepts.
- Data persistence has not been implemented in this project, meaning contacts will be lost when you close the program.
- The code can be enhanced by implementing additional features such as contact search, data import/export, among others.
